                <h1>How We Came to Be</h1>
                <h3>One day, Tom dropped his phone. He took it into his local tech repair company and they were charging him nearly $500 to fix it! Tom thought about how rigged that was to rip off customers because they couldn't do it themselves. He created Tom's Tech Repair to fix customers devices cheaper than all the competition.</h3>
